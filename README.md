## About The Project

Adamnite is a new-generation layer-1 blockchain development platform serving to 
increase blockchain adoption. By providing a development platform that enables 
developers to easily build safe and efficient decentralized applications 
(dApps), Adamnite hopes to be at the center of both dApp development and 
blockchain innovation. Adamniteâ€™s core philosophy is centered around ease of 
use, scalability, and security. Its primary focus is on solving two main 
problems in the space: a lack of proper security tools for smart contract 
developers, and a lack of widespread use of blockchain technology in both 
public and private sectors. While these problems are well-known, we believe 
that there are specific issues with current platforms that significantly 
increase the likelihood of exploits happening in dApps and hinder adoption.
